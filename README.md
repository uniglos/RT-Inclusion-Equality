# RT-Inclusion-Equality

Project brief was to build a project to gameify education relating to equality and inclusion. This eventually progressed to developing scenarios in the style of visual novels, with an overall progression system based on a typical freshers week (i.e scenarios like meeting housemates for the first time, freshers fair, going to first lesson).

Work so far on the project has involved implementing an easy to use framework for a divergent story, one that can easily be interacted with by designers. To use this system, use the Node Parser script (drag this onto an empty gameObject). The script takes in Speaker Text, a button prefab, and a transform to spawn the buttons. It also takes a Dialogue Graph. These can be created from the same 'Create' menu that makes scripts/materials etc.
