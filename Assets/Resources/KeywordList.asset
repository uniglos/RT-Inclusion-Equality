    - Key: Discrimination
      Value: Unfavourable or less favourable treatment because of a protected characteristic.
    - Key: Direct Discrimination
      Value: 'Direct discrimination - this is when someone treats you differently
        and worse because of a protected characteristic. '
    - Key: Indirect Discrimination
      Value: Indirect discrimination - this is when a policy or rule has a worse

    - Key: Discrimination by Association
      Value: "Discrimination by association \u2013 when you are treated worse than
        another person, or other people, because you are connected to someone with
        a protected characteristic. (Definition from the Equality and Human Rights
        Commission)"
    - Key: Perceived Discrimination
      Value: "Perceived discrimination \u2013 when you are treated worse than another
        person, or group of people because someone thinks that you have a protected
        characteristic (Definition from the Equality and Human Rights Commission)"
    - Key: Stereotype
      Value: A stereotype is a generalised, widely held, often untrue and unfair
        belief that people have about all people (or things) with a particular characteristic.
    - Key: Micro Aggression
      Value: Microaggressions are the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental
        slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate
        hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely
        upon their marginalized group membership. In many cases, these hidden messages
        may invalidate the group identity or experiential reality of target persons,
        demean them on a personal or group level, communicate they are lesser human
        beings, suggest they do not belong with the majority group, threaten and
        intimidate, or relegate them to inferior status and treatment. (Derald Wing
        Sue)
    - Key: Micro Affirmation
      Value: Micro-affirmations apparently small acts, which are often ephemeral
        and hard-to-see, events that are public and private, often unconscious but
        very effective, which occur wherever people wish to help others to succeed.
        Micro-affirmations are tiny acts of opening doors to opportunity, gestures
        of inclusion and caring, and graceful acts of listening. Micro-affirmations
        lie in the practice of generosity, in consistently giving credit to others.
        (Mary Rowe).
    - Key: Bias
      Value: A particular tendency, inclination, feeling or opinion to prefer one
        thing over another that prevents objectivity.
    - Key: Unconscious Bias
      Value: Unconscious bias is when we make judgments or decisions based on our
        prior experience, our own personal deep-seated thought patterns, assumptions
        or interpretations, and we are not aware that we are doing it.
    - Key: Privilege
      Value: "Simple definition: A special advantage or opportunity that is available
        to certain individuals, or groups. Privilege is a series of interrelated
        hierarchies and power dynamics that touch all facets of social life: race,
        class, gender, sexual orientation, education, religion, physical ability
        etc. One thing to keep in mind when looking at how privilege operates is
        that privilege, discrimination, and social groups all operate within interrelated
        hierarchies of power, dominance, and exclusion. Just because someone is privileged
        in one way doesn\u2019t mean they may not be underprivileged in another (and
        vice-versa). It is therefore important to be aware of the various groups
        to which one belongs in order to be able to question our own participation
        in a system of discrimination and privilege (Peggy McIntosh) "
